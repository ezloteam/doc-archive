Advanced Configuration

### Advanced Scenes

On this tab you can create Advanced commands for a scene. This way, you get
more control over that scene. Ex: you want to turn on the light when a sensor
is tripped and that sensor archives a image oncp.mios.com.  And maybe you want
the camera to be moved 3 times to the right before taking the snapshot and
then move it back to it's initial position. After you do all this, you may
want to turn off the light. This is possible with the Advanced commands in a
scene.  
  
To setup the Advanced commands, click the Advanced Tab in that Scene, select a
device, then one of it's associated commands. If you want to put an interval
between the commands, add a delay of how many seconds you want.  
  
Note: you can only pick a device or add a delay in seconds. You cannot pick a
device and in the same time add a delay.
