Walkthrough: Video Archiving

To automatically archive video from a camera:  

  * Open that camera's Control Pad (Click the camera's ![](/images/mios/wrench.PNG) icon)
  * Click the "Settings" tab.
  * To set triggers for archiving an image
    * Check the boxes next to the devices you want to trigger archiving.
    * Select how long you want Vera to archive video after your devices are "tripped"(Sensor goes off, door is unlocked, etc)
  * To turn on lights when viewing the camera
    * Check the boxes next to the lights you want to turn on while viewing it
    * Check the boxes next to the type of viewing you want to turn on the lights
      * You might want to turn on lights only when the camera activates for security purposes, not when checking up on things from your phone.
  * To archive video at a regular interval, just select how often you want us to archive and how many days of video you want us to store.
  * You can also select what lights you want to be active before capturing images form the camera by checking boxes next to the lights you want Vera to turn on for you while viewing the camera.
