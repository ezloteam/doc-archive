Vera Web Portal

The Vera Web Portal is a website that provides online services to compliment
your Vera system.  This provides you with secure access to your Vera system
over the Internet from any web browser or Internet-enabled phone.  
  
Vera uses the same security mechanisms as online banking.  If you want to be
notified of events in your Vera system, such as a security sensor being
tripped or pipes freezing, your Vera system will send the information to Vera.
The Vera system will then send you an email or SMS text message.  Vera also
stores an online archive of video from your surveillance cameras, energy
usage, system alerts and more. You can purchase optional Vera apps from Vera
marketplace.

The Vera Web Portal is a guide to help you set up your Vera system with your  
compatible devices.  
  
The Vera Web Portal enables you to:  
• [Set up your Vera
system](http://docs5.mios.com/mymios_web_portal_en_all_all.html#how to set up
mios system)  
• [Add more users to your Vera
unit](http://docs5.mios.com/mymios_web_portal_en_all_all.html#How to Add More
Users to Your Account)  
• [Set up event
notifications](http://docs5.mios.com/mymios_web_portal_en_all_all.html# How To
Set Up Event Notifications)  
• [Set up automatic video

• [Remove Vera from your
account](http://docs5.mios.com/mymios_web_portal_en_all_all.html#How to Remove
a MiOS System From Your Account)  
  
  
How to Set Up Vera System  
  
1\. To begin, make sure your device is turned on and connected to your local
network.  
2. To add a new Vera to your account, Vera scans your home network for any Vera systems not linked to a MiOS account. When found, the screen should say "New Vera systems on your home network."  
3. Click button that says Add to MiOS account. Please note: you must be using the same local network or Wi-Fi network Vera uses to add your account. You cannot add a MiOS account remotely. Once the system is added to your MiOS account, you can control the system remotely from anywhere.  
4. Once a Vera system has been added to your MiOS account it will show up under the Vera systems section. Because you added this account, you will automatically be made an account administrator. You can easily add more users to your account.  
  
How to Add More Users to Your unit  
  
1. Users register for their own MiOS account at <http://cp.mios.com/>  
2. Users provide you with their MiOS username and email associated with the account  
3. Click the Users tab on the Control menu and then navigate to the Other users Filter tab. In the Add another MiOS user area you can either enter  the new user's name and email or you can select the New MiOS account option and create an account.  
4. Select type of MiOS account to be added:  
• Administrator - User can configure the system and add or remove other MiOS
users.  
• Guest \- User has basic control over devices.  
• Notification only \- User has no access to the system, but can still receive
notifications of events and alarms.  
  
Please note:  
If you are on the same Internet connection as other Vera systems which you
cannot control and are controlled by other MiOS users, a section will appear
called "Vera systems on my home network controlled by others", which lists
them for your reference along with the MiOS usernames that can control the
system.  You will need to ask one of those users to add you if you want to
control it as well.  
  
How To Set Up Event Notifications  
  
For each Vera system, there is an Events button that shows you a list of all
the events and notifications from that system.  
  
To set up a notification:  
  
1. Go to the Setup Page of the device you want to create the notification for. Click Notifications tab: in the dropdown menu and select the type of event you'd like to be notified about.  
2. Name your newly added Notification  
3. Select specific event you'd like to be notified about and then click Add. For example, to receive notifications for an appliance, you would select "on" or "off."  
4. Select which users to be notified when this event occurs.  
  
  
How to Set Up Automatic Video Archiving  
  
The archived images show you any video images stored from your system's
surveillance cameras.  
  
To automatically archive pictures from a camera:  
1. Open camera's Control Pad (Click the camera's setup icon)  
2. Click the Settings tab.  
3. Set triggers for archiving an image:  
a. Check boxes next to each device you want to trigger archiving.  
b. Select the amount of time you want Vera to archive video after a device is
triggered (i.e. when a sensor goes off, a door is unlocked, etc.)  
4. To turn on lights when viewing camera images:  
a. Check box next to any light you want to turn on while viewing  
b. Specify when would you prefer to turn on those lights  
5. Select how often you want video archived by specifying days and/or time intervals.  
6\. Select which lights you want to be active when archiving video images by
checking boxes next to each light.  
  
  
How to Set Up Energy Usage Logging  
  
Energy usage shows the historic energy consumption in your system. To set it
up just go to the Dashboard and click on the Energy tab. Here you will be able
to see Live usage, Historical Data and much more. To see energy consumption
you need devices that are capable to log such information.  
Also you can log energy usage with your normal appliance modules or lighting
devices.  Most Z-Wave devices, like light switches, do not measure energy
usage. So, on the devices Settings tab, you can tell Vera how much energy each
device uses when it's On by putting its energy usage in the "Watts" field.
Most devices have the number of watts they use printed on them. For example, a
60W light bulb uses 60 watts. If you put '60' in the "Watts" field, then Vera
will assume the device is using 60 watts at full brightness, and a percentage
of 60 watts when dimmed to a lower level. Note that you may have a Z-Wave
switch that controls several lights. The value you put in the "Watts" field
should be the sum of all the lights controlled by a switch. So if a switch
controls four 60W overhead lights, in the "Watts" field for that switch, put
in 240. For thermostats, the "Watts" field consists of 3 numbers separated by
commas. The default is 1500,1500,300. The first number is how many watts are
used when the thermostat is in 'heat' mode; the second is how many watts are
used when the thermostat is in 'cool' mode; and the third number is for the
'fan only' mode.  
  
  
How to Remove a Vera System From Your Account  
  
To remove a Vera system from your MiOS  account, click Remove. You will no
longer have access to this system.
