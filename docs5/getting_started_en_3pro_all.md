Basic System Setup

Welcome to Vera. It is not necessary to read the complete User's Manual before
starting.   Every Vera system includes a "Quick Start Guide" to help you get
up and running very quickly without reading this User's Manual.  If you get
stuck, Vera includes "Help" buttons that link to the relevant page in this
User's Manual.  
  
Vera is the simplest and most affordable way to automate your home for
comfort, convenience and energy savings.  This Getting Started section
explains what you can do with Vera, what's involved with setup, and how this
User's Manual is organized.  First, what can you do with Vera?  
  
What can you do with Vera?  
  

### Home Security

  
Vera is a home security system that manages and controls your door locks,
alarm system, and surveillance cameras.  Using your mobile phone or any web
browser, you lock and unlock doors, arm and disarm your existing monitored
alarm system, control who has access to your home, view a video archive of
everything that happened at home and correlate this with when security sensors
are tripped.  
  
Vera introduces highly innovating home security features like "Keyless Go" for
the home. For example, "Keyless Go" can be set up to trigger lights and
appliances off, your alarm system on, and change the thermostat temperature
whenever you lock your front door from the outside. This set up reverses when
you return home and unlock the door.  
  
Vera can also send email and SMS text alerts whenever something happens at
home. Examples of these "Triggers" include alarms being tripped, water pipes
bursting, or someone entering the home.  
  

### Energy Conservation

  
Vera creates an Energy Profile to track how much energy all the devices in
your home use.  Vera also keeps a log of all your energy consumption and
creates simple graphs and charts to show your historic energy usage by device,
type of device and room.  
  
Vera can also send alerts if devices are left on when nobody is at home.
Vera's timers and events help reduce energy consumption by ensuring lights go
off promptly at sunrise, the heating/cooling system is always lowered when
nobody is home or when you go to bed, and so on.  
  
  

### Home Automation & Remote Home Management

  
You always have secure remote control over Vera with the web panel and mobile
phone applications, which are protected with the same type of Internet
security as online banking systems.  
  
Vera makes it very easy to create sophisticated "scenes", timers and events to
automate everything. Vera controls most popular home automation devices, like
Z-Wave, INSTEON, and X-10, as well as legacy serial devices like alarm panels,
pool controls, weather stations and so on.  
  
  

### Universal Remote Control & Media integration

  
Vera also controls all of your audio/video gear by infrared or serial, and
turns your mobile phones into handy and comfortable universal remote controls.
Vera also provides basic control over media devices, like set top boxes.  
  
What's involved with Setup?  
  
After you have installed Vera, there are 2 main aspects to the system: 1) The
Web Portal for Vera and 2) The Dashboard.  
  
  
The Vera Web Portal:  
  
The Vera portal guides you through setting up your Vera system. It allows you
to securely access your home remotely from the Internet or a mobile phone. If
you want to be notified when various types of events occur at home, Vera sends
you email and SMS text notifications. Optionally, it also maintains archives
of your events, energy usage, surveillance video archives, and more.  The
portal for Vera also keeps track of pending tech support requests.  
  
The portal for Vera  is a web-based solution hosted at mios.com.  Registering
for a Vera account takes less than a minute and does not require a credit card
or confidential information. It is optional, but HIGHLY recommended as your
first step. If you don't create an account to add to your unit you cannot use
some features like remotely access the Vera, install plugins or see and use
backups from our servers.

The Dashboard  

  
Your day to day operation of Vera is done using the dashboard.  All the basic
controls and system statuses for your devices are found in the Dashboard. The
icons in your toolbar, and the 'setup' icon
![/setup_icon_UI5](/images/mios/setup_icon_UI5.png)next to each device allows
you control over more advanced setup options.  The Vera market is where you
add plugins or apps to perform a multitude of functions, such as controlling
alarm panels and monitoring the weather. It's available in Apps/Install Apps.  
There are help icons ![](/images/mios/help_icon_UI5.png)scattered throughout
the Dashboard area.  These are context-sensitive and will always take you to
the relevant section of the User's Manual.

What's Next?  
  
  
The next sections of this guide explain how to [install
Vera](index.html#!docs5/installation_and_system_requirements_en_all_all.md), how to use the
[web portal for Vera](index.html#!docs5/apps_en_all_all.md), and how to get the most from your
Vera system.  
  
The [apps market](index.html#!docs5/mios_market_en_all_all.md) section will show you how to
expand the functionality of your Vera system with our app store.  
  
Since Vera can do so much, most people don't use Vera to its full potential.
The [Features & Walk-throughs](index.html#!docs5/features_en_all_all.md) section explain some
of the commonly used features of Vera and walks you through setting them up
and using them.  
  
If you're a programmer, you're in luck.  Vera is an open, developer-friendly
solution.  The [Developers ](index.html#!docs5/developers_en_all_all.md)section explain how
you can create your own apps in the apps market.  
  
The[ Reference ](index.html#!docs5/reference_en_all_all.md)section includes tips on
troubleshooting problems, like network issues and Z-Wave communication, and
how to obtain tech support.  It also covers all the options in the toolbar in
greater detail, and features a glossary of terms.  The Reference section also
contains a list of Vera compatible devices and accessories which you can use
with the system, such as a list of compatible Z-Wave devices, and tips on how
to setup and use those devices.
