Security

  

When you are away from your home and connect to the Vera system in your home
through the mios.com portal, it uses a secure web page, with the same type of
security used for online banking (SSL encryption).  You can see this by the
https:// in the address bar of your browser.  
  
When you are inside your home, on your local home network, normally you can
connect directly to your  Vera  system without going through the secure MiOS
portal, and without supplying a password.  You can this because the address
bar in your browser has http:// and not https://.  This makes it convenient to
access  Vera from within the home since you don't need a username and
password, but it also means that anybody who has physical access to your home
network, such as access to your computer, can access the  Vera system.  If you
have a Wi-Fi access point that is unsecured, and therefore allows passersby to
hop onto your home network, they can also control your  Vera system.  
  
To prevent this, you can require your  Vera system require a password from
within the home, as well as outside the home.  Simply login to your MiOS
account  
1. click the 'Setup' menu tab,   
2. go to 'Unit settings', 'Notifications per day'.  
3. just click Yes on the "Do you want to secure this  Vera ?:" option  
4.  and 'Save'.  
  
  
  
  
Note:  
 This means that your  Vera system will require you to enter your MiOS
username and password to access it from within the home as well.  With this
setting, you may have to enter your username and password more often, or be
asked for it twice.  Local http authentication is the same as what's used by
any other network devices you may have on your home network, like access
points, cameras and so on.  Note that this 'local http authentication' is not
as secure as the https security that is used on cp.mios.com
