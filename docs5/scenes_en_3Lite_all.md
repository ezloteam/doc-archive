Scenes

A scene can be a group of commands which run:

1\. at the push of a button on a device (trigger)

2\. at specific times (schedule)

3\. manually, by pressing the Run button

A scene can also notify you of events, like sending you a text message when a
door is unlocked.

Click on the wrench button of your device and you will see a notification tab.

  
To add and edit Scenes, go to "Automation". Here you will see Control Pads for
each scene. Here you will control the device behaviors for each scene, set up
triggers, and create schedules for your scenes.

If you want to create a scene first you need to go to Automation > "New
scene". You will have to give a name to your scene.

Here is where you will do most of your work on the device tab of the new scene
that you've just created.

First you have to set up what the scene should do and what commands to send,
for this you will have to chose the devices from DEVICES tab and click on the
available buttons to specify what commands should be sent

Here you will notice you have the immediate button which represents the
delays. It is set  by default on immediate. By this button you can set up
commands that your scene should run as soon as the scene is fired up. Whenever
you add another delay you will have to make sure to select that delay in order
to add commands.

To set up when the scene should run, you will have to take into consideration
both the TRIGGERS and the SCHEDULES tab.

Scene](index.html#!docs5/adding_a_scene_en_2_all.md).
