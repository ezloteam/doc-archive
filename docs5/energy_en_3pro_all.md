Energy

Vera allows you to monitor the energy consumption of  your devices which are
capable of reporting their energy usage, as well as the overall energy
consumption for each room and for the entire house. It also allows you to see
how the energy usage evolved over a period of several months, weeks or days.  
  
There are two available tools for this:  

  * The Vera native energy monitoring tool
  * The ERGY plugin by Echo Labs
  

### Vera Energy Monitoring Tool

#### Live Usage

Here you can see the current (live) energy usage of your devices. On the scale
there are several thresholds which represent the average consumption of
different size houses, to give you an idea about your house energy usage.

#### Historic Usage

Here you can see the historic energy usage for a certain time interval from
the past, which must be specified in the input boxes.

#### Measure Data

If you have any energy meters, here you can see the data recorded by them,
which includes:

  * Current kWh reading
  * The date when it started measuring
  * The time of the last kWh reading
  * Total energy consumption in this period
  * Total estimated cost, based on the cost per kWh of electricity specified in Setup >> Location
  * Estimated cost per day

###  

### ERGY by Echo Labs  

ERGY is a plugin for monitoring, logging and plotting the energy usage of your
house. There are two versions of this plugin:

  * ERGY, the paid, full version of the plugin, offering the entire set of features
  * ERGY Light, which is the free version of the plugin, with a limited set of features

In order to use this plugin you must register both yourself and your Vera on
the ERGY website, then activate the plugin from the Vera UI by going either to
the ERGY Light tab, or to the ERGY Settings tab.

You can read more about ERGY on its official website:
