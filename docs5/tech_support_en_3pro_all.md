Tech Support

  

If, after reading this documentation, you find yourself with a problem that
you're unable to resolve you can submit a trouble ticket to our technical
support team by going to Setup->Tech Support and filling in your contact
information and the details of your problem. After hitting submit, you'll see
Vera collect the logs from your box, compress them, and send them off to us.
When the process is complete, you'll see "Successfully submited ticket: XXXX."
Please reference the trouble ticket number in future correspondence about the
same issue. We'll look into the issue and get back to you as soon as we can.  
  
For full access support go to Setup -> Tech support and click the 'Enable it'
button and send us the text information from the left side of this button (
now shows Tech support full access disabled). (Ex: Tech support full control
enabled, access code 10xxx-21xxxx (ssh reference: SSH_22=10xxx
TS_SRV=ts1.xyz.com) ). Fill in your contact information and the details of
your problem and press the submit button. We need to have full access to
verify your whole logs to see what's happening with your unit.
