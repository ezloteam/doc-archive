VistaCam

Vistacam by Mi Casa Verde is a compact Indoor IP camera that supports both
wired and wireless installation. Mi Casa Verde Technical Support Team pre-
provisions each VistaCam so it works right out of the box with Vera! Set-up
doesn't get any easier. Whether for Home, Business, Facility surveillance, or
just for fun, the VistaCam is easy to install and has all the features users
need at an affordable price!  

  

Assuming that you have a main router in the house and Vera and your computer
are connected to it (we presume that your Vera has already been configured),
you can follow these steps to set up your Vista Cam in the wired or wireless
modes:

  1. Connect the VistaCam to your router using the included Ethernet cable; plug in the power supply to a surge suppressor in your electrical outlet. Connect both the power supply and the Ethernet cable to your VistaCam.

  2. After a minute or so, your Vera will auto detect the camera and you should be able to see it on your Dashboard (Devices -> Cameras). If you click on either the "view" button or the small "wrench" symbol on the camera's icon on the dashboard, you will be able to view the camera.   

  3. The VistaCam should now be working properly; the VistaCam does not have pan and tilt controls (even though these controls are shown on the camera icon).   

  

Now that you have your VistaCam working in the wired mode, you can convert to
the wireless mode by following these steps:

  1. On the window where you are viewing the image, click on the Settings tab and scroll down to the last option, which is "IP Address."   

  2. Copy that IP address and paste it into your browser's address bar and hit the Enter key (it will open the administration page for the camera); by copying the IP address into your web browser's address bar, you will be able to access the camera's control panel, where you can manage different features, like the wireless settings.   

  3. On the camera's administration page, on the left side of the page under "Setup", click on "Wireless" and fill in the SSID and the password. (IMPORTANT: the SSID is usually "Vera_xxxxx" where "Vera" is all lower case, followed by an underscore, and where xxxxx is Vera's Serial Number which is found on the back of your Vera console).

  4. Next, scroll down the administration page to the 'Security' section and click on the pull down arrow under 'Security System'. Click on the "WPA/WPA2 Personal" selection.   

  5. Once you have selected "WPA/WPA2 Personal," a password window will appear as 'Shared Key.' The password you should enter is on the back side of the Vera console as either "WiFi Pass" or "Home ID." Enter this 8 to 63 character word in the 'Shared Key' window under the 'Security' section. Note: The password should be listed as 'Shared Key' under the 'Security' section.   

  6. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on 'Save' button.   

  7. Remove the Ethernet cable and power cycle the camera by unplugging the power supply cable from the VistaCam for a few seconds; reconnect the power cable to the VistaCam. The "Power" and "Network" indicators on the front of the camera will flash up to 20 seconds, and then should resume their normal pattern. ("Power" indicator on steady; "Network" indicator flashing at a regular interval.)   

  8. Go to the dashboard and check for image from the camera.
