Guided Feature Walkthroughs

### Features & Walkthrough examples

Here are some of the popular features of the system.  Each link is a step-by-
step walk-through showing how to do it and what equipment you'll need:  
  

#### Safety & Security

  
[Keyless Go for the home](keyless_en_all_all.html_go)  
When you lock or unlock a door from the outside of the house, automatically
arm/disarm the alarm panel and do other things like adjust the lights so you
don't have to worry about forgetting them.  
  
Create permanent or temporary PIN codes for door locks  
  
[Get an alert when a sensor is tripped or a door lock is
activated](index.html#!docs5/notifications_en_all_all.md)  
  
[Archive video from a camera when a sensor is tripped or at regular
intervals](index.html#!docs5/video_archiving_en_all_all.md)  
  

#### Home Automation

  
[Create timers](index.html#!docs5/timers_en_all_all.md)  
Do certain things at times of the day or at intervals.  Examples: turn off all
the lights on weekdays at 30 minutes past sunrise.  
  
[Create events](http://docs5.mios.com/doc.php?language=1&manual=1&platform=0&p
age=scenes)  
  
Add delays to scenes  
Like turn on a light, then turn if off after 30 seconds.  Or, turn on a light,
wait 2 minutes, and then turn on another one.  
  
[Control Vera from your mobile phone](index.html#!docs5/mobile_phone_control_en_0_all.md)  
  
[Bridge multiple Vera engines](index.html#!docs5/multiple_mios_en_all_all.md)  
Z-Wave becomes less reliable in large homes or when there are large distances
without nodes, like in detached buildings.  You greatly improve reliability
when you put a different Vera system in each area, each with it's own separate
Z-Wave network, and then join them together over your home network.  This also
allows you, for example, to put a Vera engine physically next to an alarm
panel with a serial interface, and another one in front of a TV with an
infrared transmitter, and then join them all as one system.  
  
__Control UPnP devices__  
  
Audio Video & Universal remote  
  
__Add Infrared control of your audio/video gear__  
This includes using your mobile phone as a universal remote.
