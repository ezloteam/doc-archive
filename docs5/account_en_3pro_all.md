Account

  
Here you will find options for changing contact information, setting up user
alerts, and adding and removing users from the system.  
  
![](/images/mios/my_contact_info.png)  
  
To Add More Users to Your unit  
  
1. Users register for their own MiOS account at <http://cp.mios.com/>  
2. Users provide you with their MiOS username and email associated with the account  
3. Click the Users tab on the Control menu and then navigate to the Other users Filter tab. In the Add another MiOS user area you can either enter  the new user's name and email or you can select the New Vera account option and create an account.  
4. Select type of MiOS account to be added:  
• Administrator - User can configure the system and add or remove other MiOS
users.  
• Guest \- User has basic control over devices.  
• Notification only \- User has no access to the system, but can still receive
notifications of events and alarms.  
  
Please note:  
If you are on the same Internet connection as other Vera systems which you
cannot control and are controlled by other MiOS users, a section will appear
called "Vera systems on my home network controlled by others", which lists
them for your reference along with the MiOS usernames that can control the
system.  You will need to ask one of those users to add you if you want to
control it as well.
