Include and Exclude

###

Including Z-Wave devices to the Vera system's network:

  1. Disconnect all of the Vera's cables so you can carry your Vera around to the Zwave devices you want to include or exclude, like light switches, door locks, sensors and so on.
  2. Connect 4 AA batteries to the Vera system and press the "battery" button to power Vera.
  3. Wait up to 60 seconds for the "Ready" light on the Vera system to light up solid.
  4. To include devices:  Tap the Vera system's "+" button.  The "Ready" light will blink slowly, once per second, to indicate the Vera system is in include mode.
  5. Carry the Vera system around to all the devices you want to include or exclude and press each device's activate button.  When the Vera system has successfully included or excluded a device the "Ready" light will flutter for 2 seconds as confirmation.

### Excluding Zwave devices from the Vera system's network:

  1. Disconnect all of the Vera's cables so you can carry your Vera system around to the Zwave devices you want to include or exclude, like light switches, door locks, sensors and so on.
  2. Connect 4 AA batteries to the Vera system and press the "battery" button to power Vera.
  3. Wait up to 60 seconds for the "Ready" light on the Vera system to light up solid.
  4. To exclude devices:  Tap the Vera system's "-" button.  The "Ready"  light will blink rapidly, 4 times per second, to indicate the Vera system is in exclude mode.  

  5. Carry the Vera system around to all the devices you want to include or exclude and press each device's activate button.  When the Vera system has successfully included or excluded a device the "Ready" light will flutter for 2 seconds as confirmation.
Note: You can switch between include and exclude mode.  If, while in include
mode, you tap the "-" , the"Ready"  light will blink fast to indicate you are
now in exclude mode.  If, while in exclude mode, you tap the "+" button, the
"Ready" light will blink slowly to indicate you are now in include mode.

  

IMPORTANT! When you have finished adding or removing devices and want to save
your changes, press and hold the "+" button for 5 seconds to exit include mode
and save your changes.

  

When the Vera system has finished saving the new devices and resumed normal
operation the"Ready" light will come on solid again.  If you're in exclude
mode and want to save your changes, press and hold the "-" button for 5
seconds to exit include mode.
