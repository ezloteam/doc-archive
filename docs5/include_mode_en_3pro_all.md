Including and Excluding

###

Including Z-Wave devices to the Vera system's network:

  1. Disconnect all of the Vera's cables so you can carry your Vera around to the Zwave devices you want to include or exclude, like light switches, door locks, sensors and so on.
  2. Connect the battery pack to the Vera system using the short cable supplied and turn the battery pack on.  The battery pack can power the Vera system for up to 2 hours.
  3. Wait up to 60 seconds for the Zwave light on the Vera system to light up solid.
  4. To include devices:  Tap the Vera system's Zwave button.  The Zwave light will blink slowly, once per second, to indicate the Vera system is in include mode.
  5. Carry the Vera system around to all the devices you want to include or exclude and press each device's activate button.  When the Vera system has successfully included or excluded a device the Zwave light will flutter for 2 seconds as confirmation.

### Excluding Zwave devices from the Vera system's network:

  1. Disconnect all of the Vera's cables so you can carry your Vera system around to the Zwave devices you want to include or exclude, like light switches, door locks, sensors and so on.
  2. Connect the battery pack to the Vera system using the short cable supplied and turn the battery pack on.  The battery pack can power the Vera system for up to 2 hours.
  3. Wait up to 60 seconds for the Zwave light on the Vera system to light up solid.
  4. To exclude devices:  Press and hold the Vera system's Zwave button for 3 seconds and then release.  The Zwave light will blink rapidly, 4 times per second, to indicate the Vera system is in exclude mode.  

  5. Carry the Vera system around to all the devices you want to include or exclude and press each device's activate button.  When the Vera system has successfully included or excluded a device the Zwave light will flutter for 2 seconds as confirmation.
Note: You can switch between include and exclude mode.  If, while in include
mode, you hold the Zwave button for 3 seconds and let go, the Zwave light will
blink fast to indicate you are now in exclude mode.  If, while in exclude
mode, you tap the Zwave button, the Zwave light will blink slowly to indicate
you are now in include mode.

  

When you have finished adding or removing devices and want to save your
changes, tap the Zwave button once if include mode  to exit include mode and
go back to normal.

  

When the Vera system has finished saving the new devices and resumed normal
operation the Zwave light will come on solid again.  If you're in exclude mode
and want to save your changes, tap the Zwave button once to go into include
mode, then, when in include mode, tap it again.  When the Zwave light is on
solid you can now unplug the battery pack and reconnect the Vera system like
normal.
